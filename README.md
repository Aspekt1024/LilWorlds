An exploration of terrain and world generation in the Unity Engine:
* Compute shaders to generate terrain geometry
* Surface shaders for terrain and water
* Custom post processing stack including an atmosphere shader and bloom effects
* Terrain is smooth-shaded with overhangs, using marching cubes with shared vertices
